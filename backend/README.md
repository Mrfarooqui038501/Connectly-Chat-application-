1. .gitkeep = we use the file to keep the track of details in public folder 

2. DEV DEPENDENCIES and DEPENDENSCIES 
 -- Dependencies =  Required for production: These are the packages that are essential for your application to run in a production environment.Included in production builds: They are bundled with your application and deployed to production servers.
 Examples -express: A web framework for building APIs, react: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool

 --DevDependencies:Required for development: These are packages used during development but not necessary for the application to run in production.Not included in production builds: They are typically used for tasks like testing, linting, building, and formatting code
Examples - webpack: A module bundler, babel: A JavaScript compiler, jest: A testing framework,eslint: A linter for code quality

-- Why the Distinction?
Production Bundle Size: By separating development-only dependencies from production dependencies, you can reduce the size of your production bundle.
Dependency Management: It helps keep your project clean and organized.
Security: By minimizing the number of dependencies in production, you reduce the potential attack surface.

--  In summary:
Dependencies are essential for your application to function.   
DevDependencies are helpful tools for development but not required for production

3.Middleware  = Middleware in Node.js is a function that has access to the request object, the response object, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. It acts as an intermediary layer between the request and the final response, allowing you to perform various tasks before the request reaches its final destination or before the response is sent back to the client.   

-- Key functions of middleware:
- Execute any code: It can perform any arbitrary task, such as logging, authentication, or data transformation.   
- Modify the request and response objects: It can add or modify headers, cookies, or other properties of the request and response objects.   
- End the request-response cycle: It can directly send a response to the client, bypassing subsequent middleware functions.
- Call the next middleware function: It can pass the request and response objects to the next middleware function in the chain.   

Common Use Cases:
- Authentication: Verifying user credentials and granting access to protected routes.
Logging: Recording information about incoming requests and outgoing responses for debugging and analytics. - Error Handling: Catching and handling errors that occur during request processing.   
- Rate Limiting: Limiting the number of requests that a client can make within a certain time period.   
- Data Parsing: Parsing request bodies, such as JSON or form data.   
- CORS: Configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from different origins.   
- Compression: Compressing responses to reduce bandwidth usage

4. aap.use() = we use app.use for something config settings  or  for middlewares
